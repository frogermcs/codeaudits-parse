# Context
You have finished parsing and indexing the entire codebase.

# Assignment
Craft **three concise prompts** that an engineer can drop into a coding agent
to drive code simplification of this repository.  Each prompt must be:

1. Self‑contained (no extra context required beyond the parsed repo you hold)
2. Copy‑paste friendly (≤ 30 lines each, wrapped in back‑ticks)
3. Focused on *actionable* outcomes, not vague advice

Each prompt must be a fully formed instruction snippet that an
engineer can paste into another agent with zero editing.

# Style Guidelines
- Use concise Markdown headings to label prompts.
- Keep language direct and imperative (“Scan…”, “Produce…”, “Propose…”).
- Limit each bullet to a single concrete action or deliverable.
- Avoid jargon that a mid‑level developer wouldn’t know.

# Do **NOT** include any analysis of the repo itself here—only the prompts. 
No extra commentary before or after.
