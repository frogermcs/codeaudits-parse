**Objective:**
Examine the codebase to identify opportunities for applying critical software design patterns—such as Dependency Injection, Strategy, Observer, Factory, Adapter, and others—to improve the code’s maintainability, extensibility, and testability. Provide concrete refactoring steps, code examples, and rationale for each proposed design pattern.

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the Current Codebase and Architecture:**
   - Review the existing code structure, including modules, classes, and their interactions.
   - Pinpoint any signs of tight coupling, duplicated logic, or overly complex dependencies that might benefit from applying design patterns.

2. **Identify Potential Design Pattern Applications:**
   - Look for specific places where top-tier patterns—like Dependency Injection, Strategy, Observer, Adapter, Decorator, Factory (or others appropriate to the context)—could simplify code and enhance flexibility.
   - Clearly map each recognized problem to a recommended pattern, describing the core benefits of using it in this scenario (e.g., improved testability, reduced code duplication, or better maintainability).

3. **Outline Refactoring Steps and Provide Examples:**
   - For each suggested pattern, **describe a step-by-step approach** to integrate it into the existing code. 
   - Where possible, **offer concrete code snippets** demonstrating how classes, interfaces, or methods would be refactored.
   - If relevant, include ideas for reorganizing the code structure to accommodate the new pattern (e.g., creating separate modules or packages).

4. **Demonstrate Testing Considerations:**
   - Explain how these recommended patterns will **impact or improve the testing approach**. For instance:
     - How Dependency Injection makes it easier to mock or stub dependencies in unit tests.
     - How an Observer pattern might be tested via event emissions and verifying observers’ responses.
   - Provide **short testing examples or strategies** that show how to validate the new pattern implementations (e.g., example test cases, possible frameworks, or mocks/spies usage).

**Expected Output:**
A detailed **report or recommendations** that include:
1. **Specific pattern suggestions** mapped to concrete issues in the code (with reasoned justifications).  
2. **Refactoring instructions** with code samples (where practical) demonstrating how to introduce each pattern.  
3. **Testing guidance** that illustrates how using these patterns will simplify or tests.  
5. A **clear plan** for implementing or piloting the new patterns, including potential pitfalls and alternative considerations.
